# RGB-TO-GREYSCALE

IN THIS PROJECT MODULE WE WILL BE CREATING A PROGRAM THAT WILL CONVERT OUR COLOR IMAGE TO A GREYSCALE IMAGE. THE STEPS TO PERFORM IT AS FOLLOWS :-
1) IMPORT ALL THE REQUIRED PYTHON LIBRARIES.
2) COPY AND SAVE THE CODE. #DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE PATH AND PUT AN EXTRA "\" AFTER EVERY "\" TO AVOID ANY ERROR LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF THE PATH IS 'C:\USERS\PROGRAM' THEN YOU SHOULD WRITE 'C:\\USERS\\PROGRAM'.
3) CLICK ON THE RUN BUTTON TO EXECUTE THE CODE.

A NEW WINDOW WILL OPEN OUR DESIRED OUTPUT JUST BY CLICKING ENTER A SINGLE TIME. ENJOY!
